/*
  PHP script to handle file uploads and downloads for Prosody's mod_http_upload_external

  Tested with Apache 2.2+ and PHP 5.3+

  ** Why this script?

  This script only allows uploads that have been authorized by mod_http_upload_external. It
  attempts to make the upload/download as safe as possible, considering that there are *many*
  security concerns involved with allowing arbitrary file upload/download on a web server.

  With that said, I do not consider myself a PHP developer, and at the time of writing, this
  code has had no external review. Use it at your own risk. I make no claims that this code
  is secure.

  ** How to use?

  Drop this file somewhere it will be served by your web server. Edit the config options below.

  In Prosody set:

    http_upload_external_base_url = "https://your.example.com/path/to/share.php/"
    http_upload_external_secret = "this is your secret string"
    http_upload_external_protocol = "v2";
